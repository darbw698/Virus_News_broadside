          Specialty of Infectious Disease 
          
          1 Create potential training opportunities for alternative careers, 
          including dual boardcertification in infectious disease/clinical microbiology 
          or infectious disease/critical care or externships in public health or
          pharma. 
          
          2 Add infectious disease as a qualifying specialty for the
          National Health Service Corps 
          
          3 Develop novel programs within the National Institutes of 
          Health/National Institute of Allergy and
          Infectious Diseases to enhance early research opportunities in the
          field of infectious disease (eg, new R25-like programs, expansion of
          T32 training programs, improved paylines for K and first-time R01
          recipients) 
          
          4 Reform the reimbursement structure for cognitive specialties, 
          including support for antimicrobial stewardship programs
          
          5 Support an infrastructure toward stably financing necessary
          resources available during emerging epidemics, including money
          earmarked for workforce salaries”
