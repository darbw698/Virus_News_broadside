          “Box 1. Potential Steps Toward a Reinvigorated Interest in the
          Specialty of Infectious Disease 
          
          1 Create potential training opportunities for alternative careers, 
          including dual boardcertification in infectious disease/clinical microbiology 
          or infectious disease/critical care or externships in public health or
          pharma. 
          
          2 Add infectious disease as a qualifying specialty for the
          National Health Service Corps 
          
          3 Develop novel programs within the National Institutes of 
          Health/National Institute of Allergy and
          Infectious Diseases to enhance early research opportunities in the
          field of infectious disease (eg, new R25-like programs, expansion of
          T32 training programs, improved paylines for K and first-time R01
          recipients) 
          4 Reform the reimbursement structure for cognitive specialties, 
          including support for antimicrobial stewardship programs
          
          5 Support an infrastructure toward stably financing necessary
          resources available during emerging epidemics, including money
          earmarked for workforce salaries”

          close proximity. Pigs can be infected by both bird flu and human flu
          viruses, becoming potent “mixing vessels” that allow genetic material
          from each to combine and possibly form new and deadly strains”
